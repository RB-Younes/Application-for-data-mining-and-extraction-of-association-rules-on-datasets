# Application-for-data-mining-and-extraction-of-association-rules-on-datasets

## Why Association Rules Extraction?

In the field of data mining, association rule mining is a popular method aimed at discovering interesting relationships between two or more variables stored in large databases for statistical purposes.

## Our Application:

In our application, we showcase the significance of these rules by applying them to various datasets. By utilizing association rules from a dataset in medical oncology, containing information about the initial location of cancer and its potential spread, we are able to retain valuable insights into cancer propagation within the human body.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Our application features a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate easy interaction and exploration of association rules and their implications.
